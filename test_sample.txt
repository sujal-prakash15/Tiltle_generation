Article By Kathleen M. SanzoMichele L. BuenafeMorgan , Lewis &amp; Bockius LLPLaw FlashAs precision medicine gains momentum and in vitro diagnostics ( IVDs ) become increasingly used in clinical trials , pharma and biotech companies will need to develop expertise in evaluating IVD risk and , if working with IVD partners , to develop processes to ensure the partner is also properly considering risk and filing appropriate regulatory documents consistent with clinical trial timelines.Key TakeawaysBe aware that the IVD you plan to use in your clinical trial may be considered a Significant Risk ( SR ) device and require an Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) Make sure the clinical trial team is working closely with the IVD manufacturer to assess the risk status of the IVD as it is used in the clinical trial ; understand the level of validation of the test , including any software used ; and understand how it will affect the design and implementation of the trialIncorporate the IVD review and possible IDE submission into the clinical trial timelineEnsure the IVD manufacturer has the regulatory experience and data to support a successful IDE , if necessary , or assume responsibilities for the IDE submissionPrepare for early dialogue with the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) reviewing the trial about the risk status of the test , how it potentially affects study subject safety , and appropriate informed consent discussionHave systems and controls in place to reassess throughout the trial the risk status of the IVDSummary of GuidanceOn January 5 , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) issued a new draft Guidance on Investigational IVDs Used in Clinical Investigations of Therapeutic Products . Based on concerns that drug clinical trial sponsors do not appreciate the need to follow device regulations when using “ investigational ” IVDs in clinical trials , the new guidance provides more structure around the incorporation of IVDs into clinical trials , and sets out FDA 's expectations about sponsors ' scope of review of the risk of use of such IVDs .1 The draft guidelines will need to be factored into how pharma clinical trial sponsors use IVDs in a clinical trial , study design , timeline for protocol development , Investigational New Drug ( IND ) submission , and study initiation.What 's a Sponsor to Do?The burden to properly assess the risk presented by the use of an IVD in a clinical trial is on the clinical trial sponsor and its IRB . Under the draft guidelines , FDA expects a Sponsor tonotify its IRB of the use of investigational IVDs in clinical trials , even if the IRB does not request information ; provide the IRB with a risk assessment of the IVD in the clinical trial ; obtain an IDE either through or with the IVD manufacturer if the IVD presents a significant risk as it is used in the clinical trial ( see below section on Q submission meetings to obtain FDA advice on this determination ) ; continually assess the risk status of the IVD throughout the clinical trial , and if it changes from non-significant ( NS ) to significant , obtain an IDE ; andensure the lab processing the IVD is compliant with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) . Meeting with CDRH May Be UsefulFDA 's Center for Devices and Radiological Health ( CDRH ) will provide risk assessments for IVDs if requested , or meet with clinical trial sponsors to discuss the need for an IDE in “ Q ” submission meetings before starting the clinical trial to discuss questions about IVD risk , study design , and regulatory requirements.Exchanging Data with the IND Manufacturer Will Be NecessaryWhether the IVD risk status is determined with or without specific FDA guidance , there will be a need for the drug and device manufacturer to exchange trade secret/confidential information . This can be accomplished between the parties through a non-disclosure agreement or , if there is a need to provide the information about the IVD to FDA , either as part of a meeting package or in a filing ( IND or IDE ) , FDA recommends the use of Master Files and Letters of Authorization ( LOAs ) between the parties to give FDA access to reference and/or discuss relevant IVD materials.What Is an Investigational IVD?An IVD is considered an investigational device if it has not yet been cleared or approved by FDA for its intended use . FDA states that if a clinical trial will provide data about the safety or efficacy of an IVD , it is subject to the IDE requirements under 21 C.F.R. Part 812 . These requirements will apply whether or not the IVD manufacturer intends to seek FDA clearance/approval for the IVD or commercialize the IVD.How to Assess the Risk of an IVDAn IVD will be considered “ significant risk ” if the IVD is for a use of . . . “ ( 3 ) substantial importance in diagnosing . . . or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to health or safety or welfare of a subject ” or “ ( 4 ) otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health , safety or welfare to a subject . ” 21 C.F.R. 812.3 ( m ) ( 3 ) - ( 4 ) . Thus , the risk status can be dependent on the clinical consequences of erroneous or inaccurate results under this criteria , or potentially on the sampling procedures used to obtain tissue for the IVD . An IVD could present a significant risk if itproduces incorrect test results that lead to misdiagnosis and/or mismanagement of a subject 's care ; produces a false positive for certain markers that could cause subjects to be exposed to toxic therapies without any benefit ; requires invasive or additional specimen sampling ( biopsy or surgery ) that may pose serious risk ( note : additional blood draws do not increase risk ) ; produces test results that may lead to some subjects foregoing treatment known to be effective or delaying treatment in a way that they could irreversibly degrade their health condition ; produces test results that may expose subjects to safety risks/adverse events that exceed the risks of the control arm therapy or standard of care.Note that as clinical evidence around a biomarker 's positive or negative relationship increases during a trial , a non-significant risk IVD may become a significant risk IVD , so increasing data must be monitored on an ongoing basis . Other clinical consequences that can affect the IVD risk assessment includeusing it to include/exclude certain subjects ; using it to determine likelihood of experiencing Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) ; determining dosing ; monitoring effect to adjust dose or other aspect of care ; andstratification or randomization of study subjects.What Should Be in an IDE for a SR IVD?An IDE should have a description of the IVD includingtest participant technology ; equipment , reagents and supplies , calibration , and control materials ; procedures to conduct the test ; installation requirements and calibration parameters ; description of any analytes detectable by the IVD ( e.g. , SNPs , gene rearrangements , PCR primers and probe design ) ; all necessary instruments ; all software and the level of software validation available for the software ; type of specimens and collection technologies ; intended use of the IVD , e.g. , analyte to be detected and how it relates to the investigational therapy ; whether the IVD produces a quantitative or qualitative result ; disease/condition , population , frequency of test , intent to treat vs. ( not to treat ) population ; description of cut-off values ( i.e. , clinical decision points ) ; test performance and analytical validity ; preclinical or clinical information on the IVD performance ; clinical study design ; andbenefit-risk assessment : why the benefits to the study subjects outweigh their exposure to the IVD from invasive sampling to potential erroneous results.Review Process for IDEsIf the IDE is adequate for review , FDA will review it within 30 days from receipt of IDE and notify the Sponsor by letterFDA can approve an IDE with conditions , which would allow the Sponsor to proceed to enroll subjects while it responds to FDA 's conditions within 45 daysIf resolution of any issue needs to occur before subject enrollment , the IDE will be disapproved and the study can not be initiated [ 1 ] FDA does not address in these draft guidelines the use in clinical trials of laboratory developed tests ( LDTs ) , i.e. , IVDs developed and used solely within one laboratory . If an LDT is being used in a clinical trial , the trial sponsor should have evidence to support the LDT status .

Since Matt Lauer was fired from Today and NBC , and his sexual harassment scandal was unveiled , the public has been wondering when his wife , Annette Roque would pull the trigger on the divorce that has obviously been on her mind . Not only was Matt Lauer exposed for sexual harassment but his serial cheating behind the back of Annette Roque was also splashed across headlines.Annette Roque Kept Her Promise And Waited Until The Holidays Were OverWhile Matt Lauer 's wife , Annette Roque had told friends she was n't going to file for divorce during the holidays , she was seen out of her normal Hamptons surroundings coming out of the office of her divorce lawyer in NYC on December 20th . But this was n't Annette Roque 's first dealing with a divorce lawyer , as she filed for divorce before back in 2006 with NYC law firm Latham &amp; Watkins . At that time , Roque said that Matt Lauer lived his own life away from the family , including the children , and prioritized his career . “ Defendant [ Matt Lauer ] has continuously and repeatedly given higher priority to … personal interests than his family obligations to plaintiff , causing plaintiff to feel abandoned , isolated and alone in raising the parties ' children . ” Sources say that Matt Lauer and Annette Roque signed a post-nuptial agreement , paying her $ 5 million to stay with Lauer because he believed a divorce would harm his “ good guy image . ” Annette Roque and Matt Lauer Have Finally Pulled The Trigger On A DivorceUS Magazine said that it was only a matter of time for Annette Roque and Matt Lauer to file for divorce after the news broke that Roque threw Lauer off of their Sag Harbor property . And now a source close to Lauer says that both he and Annette Roque have gotten the ball rolling to divorce . “ They 've started the divorce process . He thinks he can start fresh in both his personal and professional life . ” Matt Lauer is allegedly hoping to share custody of the three Lauer children , Jack , Romy , and Thijs Lauer with estranged wife Annette Roque . Matt Lauer issued a public apology soon after NBC fired his in the midst of a scandal after a Today employee filed a complaint , but it 's unclear if he has personally apologized to Roque . “ To the people I have hurt , I am truly sorry . As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC . Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed . I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly . ” Friends Say That Kicking Matt Lauer Out Of The House Was A Sign She Was Ready For DivorceWhile Matt Lauer had initially told friends he was committed to spending time at home with his family , including wife Annette Roque , and was just fine with retirement , that plan was short-lived , as Lauer soon started talking to associates about returning to morning television , going as far as sending notes to former Today co-workers , giving them tips about ways to improve.After the holidays wrapped up and the Lauer children returned to school , sources say that Lauer 's wife , former Dutch model Annette Roque , kicked him out of the family 's Sag Harbor home for good . Matt Lauer is said to be staying at another Hamptons property owned by the couple in order to continue driving school carpool for Romy and Thijs Lauer ( Jack Lauer attends boarding school outside of the Hamptons ) , says Vanity Fair.While it 's unclear when Annette Roque found out about Matt Lauer and his “ sexually inappropriate ” behavior at work , the idea that the world now knew every detail was reportedly too much for her . An industry source said in November that details of Matt Lauer and his secret life were hardly a secret , even to Roque . “ This has been going on for months and months and everybody knew it and it was just going to be which girl came forward , and who reported it first . ” Matt Lauer And Wife Annette Roque Have Officially Started The Divorce Process is an article from : The Inquisitr	Matt Lauer And Wife Annette Roque Have Officially Started The Divorce Process
Lazio director of sport Igli Tare has ruled out the prospect of selling midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic , while also saying that he is confident that defender Stefan De Vrij will sign a new contract.Milinkovic-Savic has recently been linked with several Premier League sides , with Liverpool and both Manchester clubs thought to be among those interested.Tare however , appears to have no interest in letting one of his prised assets go , with Football Italia quoting him as telling Italian media : “ Milinkovic-Savic will certainly be a Lazio player to the end of the season , but I do n't know what could happen after that . He is very happy and Lazio are also pleased to have a player like him . “ He does not have a price-tag because he 's not on the market . ” De Vrij meanwhile is out of contract in June , but is not something that seems to be concerning Tare , who said : “ I think De Vrij will sign the new contract . It 's not easy to negotiate deals with the Dutch , but the player wants to remain , ” Milinkovic-Savic has scored seven Serie A goals this season , including two in Saturday 's 5-1 thrashing of Chievo Verona which saw Simone Inzaghi 's climb to third in the table . Both Milinkovic-Savic and De Vrij have started every league game for Lazio this season , highlighting their importance to the club 's impressive run into the Champions League places in recent weeks .

Silicon valley has a diversity problem . Sexism and racism are everywhere in the technology sector , and it 's time to put an end to it . The Internet Association , a lobbying group for some of the biggest names in tech ( think Amazon , Airbnb , Uber , Facebook , Google and Twitter ) has promised to hire a new person to focus on these issues . According to Recode , the new push comes in response to the threat of regulation from the Congressional Black Caucus.Two members of Congress wrote to the Association last November . In it , Emanuel Cleaver , II , and Bonnie Watson Coleman asked for more transparency and better policies to ensure the diversity of hires in the technology industry , ending with a bit of a threat . " If these issues go unchecked Congress will be left with few options and will demand increased regulations to address these issues , " they wrote.The Internet Association 's leader Michael Beckerman responded to this missive with a letter of his own ( it was obtained by Recode ) on January 23rd . " It is important that the diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints among internet users is represented in the industry generally and our policy engagement specifically , " he wrote . Beckerman also promised a commitment to revealing more accurate data on who 's employed by its member companies.Congressman Cleaver said that he was cautiously optimistic about the new hiring announcement . " The Internet Association has responded in a very serious and proactive manner to our concerns that there was no one guarding the guardians when it comes to the internet and its potentially negative effects on racial and gender bias , " he told Recode . " It is critical that this position be given a high level of authority and respect such that any perceived racial and gender biases can be immediately identified and addressed .

On Wednesday , Michigan judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced disgraced former gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to up to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing women and girls for several years , and using his high-powered position to do so . After days of testimony from dozens of Nassar ’s victims , Aquilina did not mince words in her own statement just before handing down the lengthy sentence to the man who officials have called “ the most prolific child molester in history . ” “ I just signed your death warrant , ” Aquilina said after announcing the prison terms . “ As much as it was my honor and privilege to hear the sister survivors , it is my honor and privilege to sentence you . Because , sir , you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again . ” Aquilina allowed more than 100 women and girls , including several prominent athletes , to address Nassar in court . She listened intently as the women or their representatives read victim impact statements , opening her court room to Nassar ’s many victims . Throughout the hearing , Aquilina ’s decision to hear the testimonies emboldened other victims to come forward and speak out at the trial . She has long been a fierce advocate for the survivors and in photos from court appearances , Aquilina has not hid her disgust for Nassar ’s crimes . “ I find that you do n’t get it , that you ’re a danger , ” she told Nassar in court . “ That you remain a danger . ” Aquilina has drawn praise from social media users , with some calling her “ an icon ” and “ the hero of the day . ” Many quoted her numerous scathing remarks directed at Nassar . Regardless , Aquilina asserted on Wednesday that the focus should be on the victims , asserting , “ It ’s their story . ” All of the women from the Nassar case including Judge Aquilina are heroes ! — Brandon michael ( @LezBMike ) January 24 , 2018 Thank you to the judge who sentenced the monster that is Larry Nassar and made sure that he will never see the light of day . And thanks to the brave victims who came forward and faced that man down . Justice was served . — Robin Byrd ( @RobinByrd3 ) January 24 , 2018 The 59-year-old is also an author who has used her legal prowess to pen crime thrillers . She also served 20 years in the Michigan Army National Guard , according to the New York Times . With all of her accomplishments , Aquilina is perhaps most famous for her connection to the years-long effort to take down Nassar . For months , she has presided over several of Nassar ’s court appearances , and in December denied a motion to move Nassar ’s trial to another venue , according to WILX . In the weeks since Nassar ’s November guilty pleas , Aquilina has put aside the impartial demeanor often associated with judges and has made her compassion for the victims clear . With that , she did not mince words last week when Nassar complained about the emotional distress that resulted from hearing the victim ’s statements . “ Spending four or five days listening to them is significantly minor , ” she said then , according to the Times , “ considering the hours of pleasure you had at their expense and ruining their lives . ” Just before sentencing Nassar Wednesday afternoon , she was sure to read aloud a letter that Nassar wrote to the court . In it , he defended his behavior and claimed he was manipulated into pleading guilty . “ I was a good doctor because my treatments worked , and those patients that are now speaking out are the same ones that praised and came back over and over , ” Nassar wrote . “ The media convinced them that everything I did was wrong and bad . They feel I broke their trust . Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned . ” Aquilina then asked if he would like to change his plea . Nassar said no . “ You ca n’t give them back their innocence , ” she said . “ You played on everyone ’s vulnerability . I ’m not vulnerable , not to you , not to other criminals at that podium . ”	Meet the Michigan Judge Who Sentenced Larry Nassar to 175 Years : I ' Signed Your Death Warrant '
